# `::legume`

A shitty knockoff of [bytemuck](https://github.com/lokathor/bytemuck) that seeks to permit
more generalized use cases.

It also seeks to provide some functionality that currently *should* be
exposed through `core` and `std` in stable Rust, but currently as of writing is not.

## Should I use this?

NO. NO. NO.
